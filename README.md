Error Handlers Demo Smart Contract
This smart contract demonstrates the usage of the require(), assert(), and revert() error handlers in Solidity. It showcases different functionalities and scenarios where these error handlers can be applied.

Functionality
The smart contract includes the following functionalities:

setValue: This function sets the value variable, allowing only the contract owner to call it. It utilizes the require() function to enforce the ownership restriction and checks that the provided value is greater than zero.

getValue: This function retrieves the current value stored in the contract. It is a simple read-only function.

transferOwnership: This function enables the contract owner to transfer ownership to a new address. It verifies that the caller is the owner and checks that the new owner address is valid using the require() function.

assertExample: This function demonstrates the usage of the assert() function. It takes two input parameters and asserts that they are not equal. If the assertion fails, it results in an unrecoverable error.

revertExample: This function showcases the revert() functionality. It checks if two input parameters are equal and reverts the transaction with a custom error message if they are.

Usage
To utilize this smart contract, follow these steps:

Deploy the contract to your preferred blockchain network.

Call the setValue function with a non-zero value from a different address than the contract owner. Observe the error message generated by the require() statement.

Call the transferOwnership function with an empty address as the new owner. Observe the error message generated by the require() statement.

Call the assertExample function with equal input parameters. Observe the unrecoverable error generated by the assert() statement.

Call the revertExample function with equal input parameters. Observe the custom revert error message.

Please note that this README file provides an overview of the functionalities and usage of the contract. Refer to the corresponding Solidity code for a complete implementation.

Considerations
When using error handlers, it is crucial to consider the following:

Properly validate inputs and enforce necessary conditions to avoid potential errors and vulnerabilities.

Carefully design error messages to provide clear and informative feedback to users and developers.

Test the contract thoroughly and handle potential error scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.

Understand the gas cost implications of error handlers, as they can affect transaction costs.

Remember to follow best practices and security guidelines when deploying smart contracts in production environments.
